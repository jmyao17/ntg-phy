     <p id="d5e107">Neutrino detectors record the number and energy of a reactor&rsquo;s antineutrinos, which are produced as a byproduct of fission. The fission of a uranium-235 nucleus typically leads to the emission of six antineutrinos as the fission products decay. Fuel rods also contain uranium-238, which can absorb a neutron and become plutonium-239, a nucleus that releases four antineutrinos as it decays.</p>
